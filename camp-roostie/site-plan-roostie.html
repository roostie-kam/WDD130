        This is the epitome of all the High points and the hardest to climb of the lower 48. 
        You will never forget your visit to Kings Peak, Utah. Climbing the peak combines with 
        fascinating scenery to make it a truly unforgettable hike. The peak is filled not only 
        with scree making it the hardest of the lower 48 to hike without the need for specialized 
        equipment, At 13, 528 ft, it’s best accessible by the Henry Fork Trail Head. Hiking Kings Peak,
        is free and as a result, it’s a very popular peak to climb. Hiking to the peak can be done in 
        one day, but it’s recommended to do it in 2-4 days.
