        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Winding through the majestic canyons in central Utah, in some of the 
           most desolate land anywhere in the state, the Green River flows towards 
           the Mighty Colorado River and ultimately the sea. From its high grey stone cliffs, 
           beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this river run well-known. 
           This 84-mile trip runs from Sand Wash to Swaseyâ€™s Rapid (just outside Green River, Utah) 
           and it boasts some outstanding scenery, fascinating geologic formations, evidence of 
           prehistoric and historic human activity, and provides great whitewater opportunities. 
           Desolation Canyon is rated as a Class II/III and can be typically done in 6 days 
           Desolation Canyon is recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on 
           its distinctiveness and rich history that the gorge tells.

        <p> This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. 
            You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon. Grand Canyon river rafting 
            combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable 
            river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, 
            but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river. CLASS I - X: 
            The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are 
            technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids 
            and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular 
            I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
