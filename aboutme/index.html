    <p>Hello to all of you. I am Scott Kamerath. I was born in Germany and I am an Army brat. I had the opportunity to be baptized a member of the Church in the Tabernacle 42 years ago. I have the blessing and opportunity to be the Dad to 6 great kiddos. I live in Utah, somewhere in Utah County, LOL. However, I grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah. I have been married for a little while and I met my wife online.</p>
    <Being a student here at BYU Pathway, BYUI, has been an amazing journey. I am working on my 2nd BA Degree. This has given me the opportunity to understand that life isn't stereotypical. What this means is that I don't geth the typical golden years that many talk about. LOL.
